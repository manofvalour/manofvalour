# 👋 Hi there, I'm Emmanuel Ajala

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I specialize in designing, training, and deploying ML models that are not just accurate—but scalable, adaptable, efficient, and production-ready. I’m looking to collaborate on open-source ML projects, AI for social good, and anything that blends data with impact.


## 🚀 What I Do
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: From classical models to neural networks, I build solutions using Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.
- 🛠 **MLOps & Deployment**: I love turning prototypes into production—using FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, and CI/CD pipelines (Github Actions and Jenkins).
- 📊 **Data Engineering**: Skilled in SQL, data wrangling, and feature engineering to make raw data usable and powerful.
- 🔍 **Experimentation & Optimization**: I iterate fast, tune hard, and always keep performance metrics in sight.


## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- 🧬 Generative AI & LLMs
- ⚙️ Advanced MLOps workflows
- 🧩 Multi-modal learning and model interpretability


## 📂 Featured Projects
- **HotelReservationCancellation** – ML-powered prediction tool for Hotels
- **PhishingData** – Prediction tool for companies to detect Phishing websites in real time
- **TextSummarizer** – Finetuned a pretrained model for summarization task
